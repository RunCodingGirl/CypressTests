# Introduction
Welcome to my Cypress testing portfolio project! This repository showcases my expertise in end-to-end testing using Cypress. In this project, I have demonstrated my skills by creating a suite of Cypress tests for a web application. I have implemented e2e tests for https://www.sportsdirect.com/ site.

# Getting Started
 1. Create cypress.env.json in root folder
 2. Specify login and password in correspondent properties 
  {
    "userName": $myLogin,
    "userPassword": $myPassword
  } 
 3. Install dependencies
    yarn install

# Run Cypress Tests Locally
  1. Run the all tests - yarn cy:run
  2. Open cypress app - yarn cy:open
